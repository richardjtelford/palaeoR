##
Packages evolve ... things break.

Code alone is not enough to ensure reproducibility. Also need to use same version of dependencies - R packages, etc.

### Solutions

- **[packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/)**. Keeps track of and installs R packages used (integrated with Rstudio)

- **[renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html)**. Likely to replace packrat.  

- **[rocker](https://www.rocker-project.org/)**. Runs R code in a docker container. 

- **[codeocean.com](codeocean.com)**. Cloud-based computational reproducibility platform
