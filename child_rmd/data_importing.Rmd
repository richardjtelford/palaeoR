## Which format?

Almost all data formats can be imported into R

- text format (.csv, .txt etc) with `readr::read_delim` or `read.table` and related functions
- excel files with `readxl::read_excel`
- databases with `DBI::dbConnect` and the `dplyr` functions.
- shapefiles with `sf::st_read`
- LiPD: [Linked Paleo Data](http://wiki.linked.earth/Linked_Paleo_Data)
- etc

## Basic principles of data formatting

- be consistent
- write dates as YYYY-MM-DD
- do not leave any cells empty
- put just one thing in a cell
- organize the data as a single rectangle (with subjects as rows and variables as columns, and with a single header row)
- create a data dictionary
- do not include calculations in the raw data files
- do not use font color or highlighting as data
- choose good names for things
- use data validation to avoid data entry errors
- save the data in plain text files.  [Broman & Woo (2018) Data Organization in Spreadsheets](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989)

## Other peoples data

No guarantee principles followed!

Do not edit the raw data!

Reproducible solution is to use code to import.

## Text files

`readr::read_delim` is faster and has better defaults than `read.table`

Reports what how it formatted data (can force format if needed)

Returns a `tibble`

```{r readr, eval = FALSE}
GeoB8323_1 <- read_delim("data/GeoB8323-1_pollen_analysis.tab", 
                         skip = 75, 
                         delim = "\t")
GeoB8323_1
```


## Excel files

Import the Wonderkrater pollen data.

You will need to check the help file to see the options

```{r excel, echo = TRUE}
library("readxl")
?read_excel
```


## Importing lots of files

If all files have the same format, it is possible to load them all at once

```{r multiple_files, eval = FALSE}
library("tidyverse") #want to use purrr package

files <- list.files(path = "data/", #where to look
                    pattern = "\\.tab$", #name must end .tab
                    full.names = TRUE)# return name and path

files %>%
  set_names() %>% #want to be able to use names
  # run read_csv on each name and return results as a single data.frame
  map_df(read_delim, delim = "\t", .id = "name")
#actually need something a little more complex as skip needs to be set
#would be easier to use `pangaear` package
```

## Task

Import one of your data files (or improve your import code)
