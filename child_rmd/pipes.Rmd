## Pipes

Pipes are commonly used with `tidyverse` but can be used with any function.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
iris %>% group_by(Species) %>% 
  filter(Sepal.Length > 5)

filter(group_by(iris, Species), Sepal.Length > 5)
```

Never need to use pipes, but can make code more readable

Most useful pipe is `%>%` (Rstudio shortcut ctrl-shift-m)

Passes result of code on left of pipe to function on right

Other pipes in the `magrittr` package

## Mashed potato

```{r potato, eval = FALSE}

buy("potatoes", kg = "1") %>% 
  peel() %>% 
  cut() %>% 
  boil(minutes = "15") %>% 
  drain() %>% 
  mash(add = list("salt", "milk", "butter")) %>% 
  serve(decorate = "parsley")
```
