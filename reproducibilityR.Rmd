# Why Reproducibility? {.section}

## Why? 

"Despite extensive efforts, we were not able to reconstruct where the error occurred. It probably resulted from using erroneously an earlier version of the analysis, or an issue with file naming."

Many papers cannot be reproduced:

- unclear methods?
- error in code (whose)
- error in data (especially hand-cleaned data)
- misconduct (non-zero probability)


## Basic idea

- Data cleaning
- Data formatting
- Statistical analysis
- Plotting
- Putting numbers in the MS

... all done with code. All reproducible.

## Open Data

Archive raw data to suitable archive 

 - [Neotoma](https://www.neotomadb.org/)
 - [Pangaea.de](Pangaea.de) 
 - [NCDC](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/paleoclimatology-data)
